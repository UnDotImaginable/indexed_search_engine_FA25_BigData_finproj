This is the final project of our Big Data class.
This class was taken during the **Fall 2025** semester. Our instructor was **Dr. Sunnie Chung**.
Group members were **Brandon Wendell**, **Veer Gaudani**, and **Issa Hamideh**

This project involves building a small search engine from ~200 State of the Union Addresses. We pre-process these texts to build an inverted index table. 
We then use this table to build document vectors for each document. 
Then, we pre-process any incoming queries the same way we pre-processed the texts to create a query vector. 
We calculate the cosine similarity between it and all document vectors to retrieve the top 5 most relevant documents to our query.

Also, the .csv files are placed here as .zip files as they in their natural state are too big for GitHub.
